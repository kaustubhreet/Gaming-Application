# Gaming-Application

This project is based on concept of OOPs that stands for object oriented programming. We
have tried to such user friendly simple gaming application using c++ that runs in any C++
compiler. Here, user can type name and choose the types of game which they wanted to play
like share marketing game like casino, educational games like quiz, animated games like space
shooter and bricks shooter. All games are going to be interesting for users especially
marketing type game (casino). We have tried hard to make window’s screen clean and new
screen appear after every conditions.

C++ game
Well, C ++ does a exceptional job. It's a compiled language, now no longer an interpreted
programming language, so it is approximately as rapid because the pc itself. Video video
games can include loads of hundreds of traces of code which can be processed via way of
means of the sport engine, and the speech of the person that writes the code in programming
is simply too slow, that could have an effect on the gaming experience. For this reason, C ++
has come to be the usual for embedded code. It had the finest effect at the improvement of
sport engines. Unity, Unreal, and Frostbyte had been all written the usage of the C ++
programming language.
Anyone with a transient hobby in sport improvement is aware of how Unreal and Unity have
prompted sport makers. In addition, maximum sport engines also can use C ++, so that you can
expand now no longer only sport engines, however additionally executable video games.

Secret / Detective:
The task is to solve critical math problems and score will appear if you are right but if your
given answer is wrong then you will be asked again to solve that ,without solving previous
question user can’t go to next questions. Each time hardness of question will increased
randomly everytime. By playing this game, user can get their critical thinking skills and logical
reasoning skills will definitely improved.

Brick Breaker:
The task is to shoot. It has a small ball that hits the bricks with the help of a little platform at
the bottom. The player uses this platform to bounce the ball. The more you break the bricks,
the more you score. If you miss the ball to bounce then game over and final end screen will
appear with score card. The following are the milestones of the project implementation.
• Display bricks and disappear after hitting the ball.
• Small platform moving left and right
• The ball must bounce after hitting brick and platform at the bottom
• Score display

Duck Duck Go:
The task is to pass the coming poles without colliding with them. The number of poles will you
cross then your score also get increases, But if you touched or struck with any incoming pole
then you will lose game and screen appears with “Game Ended” and your final Score will be
visible.

Quiz game:
The task is to create a quiz game where the user will be asked questions and the result of each
questions with its correct answer will be displayed whether it is correct or wrong with the
updated score will be shown at screen. At last screen user’s report will be displayed with
condition of pass/fail, minimum percentage to pass quiz, and much more.

Casino game:
Casino Game or Number Guessing Game both are same, in Casino we have to guess a number
and if the number is matched with the Winning Number or Random Number than you will win
the Lots of Money (10 times more). Here in the programming language we have a random
number instead of Guess the number is real life. Let explanation our code step by step, First
we will Take a Username and total amount of Money in Deposit, Now player can play a Casino
Game but before playing a game, player need to Bid for every time, if number input by player
is not match with random number then bid money will be lose and after deduction from
original money then finally at last if play lose whole money then screen will appear as “no
money left” and ask to deposit money if they wanted to play again.


Concept used:
Object Oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept
of classes and objects. It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces
of code blueprints (usually called classes), which are used to create individual instances of
objects. There are many object-oriented programming languages including
JavaScript, C++, Java, and Python.
